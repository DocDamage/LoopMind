“Is this a new chat?” ChatGPT said:
Yep, this is a fresh new chat! Feel free to dive in with whatever you want to talk about or ask. I'm all ears.

You said:
“Alright, um, I wanna discuss and then map out and design and code, um, my own DAW.” ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, that sounds like a really cool project. Designing your own DAW is definitely ambitious, but it's also a fun challenge. We can absolutely break it down into steps—like thinking through the features you want, the kind of user interface you'd like, and then we can chat a bit about the coding side. So yeah, let's get into it!

You said:
“When designing my own DAW, I know that they have, like, open source, uh, to start you out with. And then maybe even, like, an open source, uh, like, template.” ChatGPT said:
Yeah, you're totally on

You said:
“To have like an immediate DAW, I want to be able to like maybe find like somebody else's template for a DAW and then make it my own.” ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, and that

You said:
“I want to add a bunch of AI tools.” ChatGPT said:
Nice! That's a really cool angle to take it in. I mean, these days a lot of DAWs are starting to add little AI features, but if you're building your own, you can kind of get creative

You said:
“So, what do you suggest I use to get going, like, what's the best way to start this, like, as far as open source tools? I don't want to use Audacity because I hear that's not as strong as others that maybe I could use.” ChatGPT said:
Yeah, totally get that. Audacity is kind of like the old faithful, but it's not really the most modern or flexible if you want to do a lot of AI customization. So a couple of ideas: there's something like JUCE, which is a really popular C++ framework for audio apps. It's not exactly a full DAW template, but it gives you a lot of the building blocks so you can kind of create your own. And then there are a few open-source DAWs out there, like Ardour, that you can look at if you want to see how they're structured. And from there, you can add your own AI tools on top of that. So that might be a good starting point.

You said:
“Talk to me about juice.” ChatGPT said:
Yeah, for sure! So JUCE is actually pretty well-loved in the audio developer community. It's kind of like this big C++ framework that's specifically made for making audio software. So a lot of companies and even like independent developers use it to build plugins, synths, and even DAWs.

What makes it nice is it's cross-platform, so you can build something and run it on Windows, Mac, Linux without totally redoing all your code. And it gives you a bunch of tools for the audio engine, the user interface, and all that good stuff. So if you start with JUCE, you're basically starting with a really strong foundation and then you can just focus on layering in your special AI features on top of that.

You said:
“So what do I go to Juice's website and like, download a file and it'll install where it needs to install and then I work out of that folder?” ChatGPT said:
Yeah, you've got the right idea. Basically, you just head over to the JUCE website, and they have a free tier that you can download. And once you download it, it gives you kind of a whole folder structure, and you can start a new JUCE project. And then, yeah, you just work from there. So it kind of sets you up with all the tools in one place, and then you just start building out your DAW from that folder. So it's pretty straightforward once you get it installed.

You said:
“You said free tier, does that mean that there's other tiers?” ChatGPT said:
Yeah, exactly. So JUCE does have a free tier, which is great to get started and kind of learn the ropes. And then they have these other tiers if you want to do commercial releases or you want a few extra bells and whistles. But honestly, for just getting started, you can do a lot with the free tier. And then if you decide you love it and you want to go pro, you can always upgrade later on. So it's pretty flexible.

You said:
“I will explain the free tier a bunch more and then tell me about the paid tiers afterwards.” ChatGPT said:
Sure thing! So let's break it down a bit more.

The Free Tier
So the free

No worries, let's dive

You said:
“Repeat that, because you didn't say anything.” ChatGPT said:
Oh, sure! Let me just run through that again. So basically, with the JUCE free tier, you get everything you need to start developing. It's got all the core framework features, so you can build and test your app. The main difference is that if you want to release it commercially without any kind of JUCE splash screen, that's when you'd look at the paid tiers.

The Paid Tiers
So the paid tiers basically let you remove branding, and they give you a commercial license and a few extra advanced features if you need them. But to start out, you really can just stick with the free tier and get comfortable. And then if you decide you want to release your DAW to the world commercially, you can look at those paid options. So hopefully that gives you a nice clear picture!

You said:
Transcript Unavailable ChatGPT said:
Yeah, absolutely! If that's the case, then you're pretty much golden with the free tier. If you don't mind a little JUCE splash screen and you're just using it for yourself or sharing it with some friends, you don't need to pay for anything. You can just tinker around, build your DAW, add your AI features, and have fun. So yeah, you're totally good to go on that front.

You said:
“Also, explain step-by-step how I would start the process of doing it, from downloading the software, the true software, to starting to code.” ChatGPT said:
Absolutely, let's walk through it step by step.

Step 1: Downloading JUCE
First, you'd head to the JUCE website, and you'll find their download section. Just grab the free version installer for your operating system, whether you're on Windows, Mac, or Linux.

Step 2: Installing JUCE
Once you download it, just run the installer. It'll set up everything you need. And basically, it will create a folder structure where you have the JUCE libraries and the Projucer, which is kind of like their project management tool.

Step 3: Creating a New Project
Once it's installed, you open up the Projucer, and you basically say, "Hey, I want to create a new project." It will give you a bunch of templates to choose from, and you can pick an audio application template.

Step 4: Setting Up Your Coding Environment
From there, the Projucer will generate a project for you. You can open it up in whatever IDE you like—Visual Studio, Xcode, or whatever you're comfortable with.

Step 5: Start Coding and Customizing
Now you're in the code! You can start building out your DAW's features, adding your AI tools, and just experiment from there. And like we said, you can just keep it on your computer or share it with friends without any commercial licensing worries. So that's pretty much the flow!

You said:
“so like is any of that drag and drop and and and just like i'm not really explaining you're not really explaining it too well for me” ChatGPT said:
Yeah, no problem at all—let me clarify a bit more. So the initial setup, like using the Projucer, is a little bit drag-and-drop in the sense that you can click and choose templates and kind of visually set up your project. But once you're actually coding the DAW, it's mostly writing code. It's not like a full drag-and-drop builder, but you do have a lot of helpful tools to organize things visually.

So I totally get it if it feels a bit abstract—basically the first couple of steps are just downloading and clicking through a few setup screens. And then once you're in, you're writing code to customize it. So I hope that helps a bit more! Let me know if you need more detail.

You said:

Oh, no worries at all! I’ll repeat that for you. Basically, what I was saying is that the first part is pretty straightforward: you download JUCE, run the installer, and use their Projucer tool to set up a project template. That part has some visual elements, but once you get into the actual coding, it's mostly writing code. So it's not entirely drag-and-drop, but it does give you a nice structure to start from. And if you have any more questions, just let me know!

You said:
“What are the elements that I can drag and drop and design visually before I start coding?” ChatGPT said:
Yeah, definitely. So inside the Projucer, you can visually set up some of the project details. For example, you can choose the modules you want to include, and you can kind of visually lay out some of the user interface components. There's a GUI editor that lets you do a bit of drag-and-drop for the interface elements. So you can lay out buttons, sliders, and that kind of stuff visually before you start coding the logic behind them. So there's a little bit of that design phase you can do visually, and then you dive into the code. So it's kind of a nice mix.

You said:
“So if I want, I could design it to look like, say, FL Studio if I wanted to, only better.” ChatGPT said:
Yeah, exactly! You totally could. You have the flexibility to design the interface however you like. If you want to give it that FL Studio kind of vibe but then add your own twist and make it even better for your needs, you can totally do that. So yeah, you get to design it visually and then code in all the features you want. It's your playground!
