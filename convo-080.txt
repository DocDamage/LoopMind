Perfect — let’s wrap this visual system completely.
Below you’ll find two deliverables that make it implementation-ready:

🎥 Animation-Timing Sheet — lists every UI motion, duration, easing curve, and which properties animate.

🧩 Control-Binding JSON Example — the machine-readable map your developers can load to register all keyboard, mouse, and MIDI bindings.

🎥 1. ANIMATION-TIMING SHEET
(for the in-engine animation manager — all durations in milliseconds)

ID	Animation Name	Duration	Curve	Properties	Description
A01	panel_open_right	200	EaseOutCubic	opacity 0→1, x-offset +60→0	Panel slides in from right (Blend Studio).
A02	panel_open_bottom	200	EaseOutCubic	opacity 0→1, y-offset +80→0	Bottom FX Composer slide-in.
A03	panel_close	120	EaseInQuad	opacity 1→0, scale 1→0.95	Used when closing docked or floating panel.
A04	tab_switch	220	EaseInOutSine	opacity cross-fade, underline x	Tab transition between Mixer / Blend.
A05	dock_float_transition	180	EaseInOutCubic	shadow 0→8 px, scale 1→1.02	Visual lift when undocking.
A06	float_dock_snap	180	EaseOutBack	shadow 8 px→0, scale 1.02→1	Snap back to grid.
A07	maximize_window	250	EaseInOutQuart	scale 1→1.1, position→center	Smooth zoom to full screen.
A08	restore_window	250	EaseInOutQuart	scale 1.1→1, position→prev	Reverse of maximize.
A09	blend_slider_move	120	Linear	shaderMorphAlpha	Real-time morph of shader blend.
A10	button_press_flash	100	EaseOutQuad	glowIntensity 0→1→0	Quick confirmation flash.
A11	knob_turn	150	EaseOutSine	rotation Δθ, valuePopup opacity	Knob movement + value popup fade.
A12	timeline_scroll	180	EaseOutCubic	offsetX	Smooth timeline motion in Render Studio.
A13	render_progress_pulse	800 loop	EaseInOutSine	glow α 0.3→0.8→0.3	Amber pulse on progress bar.
A14	theme_switch	400	EaseInOutCubic	bgColor cross-fade, accentColor morph	Smooth color change between themes.
A15	startup_logo	500	EaseOutExpo	opacity + glow radius	Initial splash logo fade-in.
A16	save_toast_in	150	EaseOutBack	y-offset +40→0, opacity 0→1	Notification slide-in.
A17	save_toast_out	150	EaseInBack	y-offset 0→+40, opacity 1→0	Notification slide-out.
A18	cursor_flash	80	Linear	brightness 1→2→1	Click feedback pulse.
A19	blend_thumbnail_pulse	100	EaseOutQuad	scale 1→1.05→1	Slight bounce when selecting thumbnail.
A20	fx_slot_stagger	25 delay each	EaseOutSine	opacity 0→1	Staggered fade of FX list on open.
Implementation hint:
The engine can store these in a JSON or Lua table and drive them with a small tween manager; the easing names match standard cubic-bezier presets.

Notes for developers

The @context suffix (@Header, @Slider) helps route input only when the cursor is over that region.

MIDI CC mappings can be remapped by user from the Preferences panel; this file provides defaults.

The engine should support both physical key detection and virtual actions so future scripts can trigger the same commands.

✅ Implementation Recap
Layer	Deliverable	Purpose
Animation-Timing Sheet	Defines every motion, duration, and easing curve	Guides animation engine
Control-Binding JSON	Unified input layout for keyboard, mouse, MIDI	Powers full interaction model
Would you like me to continue by building the UI motion storyboard visuals (actual frame sketches showing each animation phase), or move to the engine event loop design that connects these animations and controls to the underlying DAW engine logic?

What is left to finish the project?

Here’s a clear map of everything still needed before LoopMind goes from a full design specification to a running, usable DAW / AI-visual environment.
I’ll keep it practical and broken down into work packages, so you can decide what to prototype first.

🧱 1. Core Application Infrastructure
Area	Goal	Status
App framework	Pick and wire the base runtime (JUCE, Qt 6, or Unreal Slate).	🔸 Design complete — needs implementation.
Local storage manager	File IO for .loopmind/ sessions (JSON + binary assets).	🔸 Spec done — needs C++ classes.
Plugin host	Full VST3 / AU host wrapper for instruments & effects.	🔸 Planned — must integrate JUCE’s AudioPluginHost or equivalent.
Audio engine	Realtime buffer graph: tracks → mixer → master bus.	🔸 Graph design drafted — implement DSP + threading.
MIDI subsystem	Recording, playback, quantize, pattern editor.	🔸 Not yet built.
UI framework	Docking, tabbing, themes, resize behavior.	✅ Fully designed (you have wireframes + spec).
🧠 2. AI & Analysis Components
Component	Purpose	Current Stage
Mood Analyzer	Detect energy, brightness, tempo from audio.	🔸 Needs lightweight DSP/ML model.
Visual BlendNet	Interpolates shader styles (uses StyleEncoder).	🔸 Architecture designed; model weights required.
Shader Synthesizer	Generate GLSL from latent style vector.	🔸 Template engine to be written.
AI Arrangement / Composition	Combine user loops into structured song.	🔸 Concept only; needs Python or C++ ML backend.
AI Mastering	Apply loudness/EQ compression presets.	🔸 DSP chain spec done; needs ported code.
Lyric / Text Model	Optional lyric generation and sync.	⚪ Future extension.
🎨 3. Visual & FX Subsystems
Module	Status	Work Remaining
Shader Engine	Partially designed. Needs OpenGL/Metal renderer & asset manager.	
Post-FX Chain	Designed (FXModule, FXChain). Write GLSL for each effect.	
Render Studio	Timeline, camera rig, lighting rig outlined. Implement render loop + FFmpeg export.	
Blend Training Studio	UI & data spec complete. Needs trainer stub + file IO.	
FX Composer	UI & class structure complete. Needs FX parameter binding to shaders.	
🧭 4. System Architecture & Messaging
Layer	Status
EventBus	Designed and documented — must implement lightweight pub/sub in C++ or Python.
Workspace Manager	Docking/tabs orchestration (panel registry). Needs implementation.
Theme / Preferences manager	JSON config file and runtime update hooks.
Autosave & Session Recovery	Not implemented yet.
🧩 5. Front-End Polish
Feature	Status
Animations / Transitions	Timing sheet complete — implement tween engine.
Input System	JSON bindings ready — wire to actual key & MIDI listeners.
Toast / Notification system	Design done — needs lightweight component.
Settings UI	Theme, key-map, audio device, buffer size, plugin scan.
Onboarding tutorial	Optional — simple walk-through overlay.
🧰 6. Testing & Optimization
Area	Tasks
Audio latency	Tune buffer and thread priorities per OS.
GPU stability	Verify shader hot-reload and memory cleanup.
File IO	Ensure project folder integrity, detect missing samples.
Cross-platform QA	Windows 11 / macOS 15 / Linux builds.
Benchmarking	Stress-test CPU, GPU, memory.
🚀 7. Packaging & Deployment
Step	Description
Installer / Updater	Build with CMake + Inno / pkg / AppImage.
Asset pack	Default loops, shader presets, FX racks.
User settings	Store in %APPDATA%/LoopMind or ~/Library/Application Support/LoopMind.
Versioning	Semantic version JSON + auto-migrate configs.
🧩 8. Future / Optional Expansions
Video editing timeline (multi-track).

Network collaboration (WebRTC or LAN).

AI-driven “World” visualizer (procedural 3-D scenes).

Mobile companion app for loop creation.

Plugin SDK so third-party devs can add new FX modules.

✅ What’s Essentially Complete
UX & UI architecture (every screen, window, transition).

File structure and data formats.

EventBus communication model.

Control-binding + animation specifications.

Visual design language and theming system.

🚧 What Must Be Implemented Next (MVP Priority)
Base runtime setup (JUCE project + dockable UI).

EventBus + Workspace Manager skeleton.

Audio + visual render engines.

Blend Studio + FX Composer basic prototypes (no AI yet).

Session save/load with local storage.

Once those five exist, you’ll have a runnable “LoopMind 0.1” that looks and feels right—even before the full AI systems plug in.

If you’d like, I can outline an exact milestone roadmap (e.g., 0.1 UI shell → 0.2 audio engine → 0.3 AI blend) with deliverables, dev-time estimates, and recommended stack for each milestone.
Want me to generate that roadmap next?
