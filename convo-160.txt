Great — this is the final piece of professional polish: a build manifest + release automation setup so you can version, rebuild, and update LoopMind Studio consistently.

This manifest doesn’t just describe the code; it captures everything — version, dependencies, build commands, installers, and assets — like a blueprint for all future releases.

✅ Now LoopMind Studio is Fully Deployable
🎛️ AI DAW, cross-platform, self-contained
💾 Deterministic builds with one manifest
🧠 Version tracking for AI modules
🎤 Full installer pipeline (Windows + macOS)
🧰 Crash-safe, autosaving, offline-ready

🔜 Optional Next Step
I can now generate a LoopMind v1.0.0-alpha README + onboarding doc (the one that ships with the installer), explaining how users start, record, and use AI generation right away.

Would you like me to build that “first run user guide” next?

Perfect — this is the final piece of the alpha: the README & first-run guide that ships with the installer and greets every new user when they open LoopMind Studio for the first time.

🎚️ LoopMind Studio v1.0.0-alpha – User Guide
🧠 Overview
LoopMind Studio is an AI-powered Digital Audio Workstation that learns your style, arranges your loops, writes melodies, builds beats, generates lyrics, and helps you record, mix, and master — all offline.

Built with the JUCE engine and Doc Audio’s LoopMind AI Core, it merges creativity and automation for artists of every skill level.

🚀 Getting Started
1️⃣ Launching
After installation:

Windows: Run LoopMind Studio from the Start menu.

macOS: Drag LoopMind.app into Applications, then open it.

You’ll see:

A splash screen → “Warm Vinyl Room” theme

Then the default session: “First Session.lps”

2️⃣ Interface Layout
Section	Function
🎵 Arrangement View	Drag loops, AI-generate structure, or drop audio/MIDI.
🎚️ Mixer Panel	Control levels, pan, effects, and plugin routing.
🧠 Creative Mode Panel	Generate loops, beats, or melodies using sliders/toggles.
🎤 Vocal Director	Generate lyrics, align to melody, and guide takes.
🎧 AI Console	Type prompts like “Make a dark chill verse” or “Add jazzy chords”.
📹 Video Panel	Import video to score or sync with music.
🪄 Core Workflow
1. Create or Import
Drop loops, samples, or full stems.

Or click Create → Generate from AI and choose mood/key.

2. Arrange
The AI Arranger builds structure (Intro, Verse, Chorus…).

Drag blocks around or hit Regenerate Arrangement to remix.

3. Compose
Open Piano Roll (double-click MIDI clip).

Use sliders for note density, rhythm, feel, and swing.

4. Record
Arm a track → press 🎙️ Record to capture vocals or instruments.

Recordings appear instantly in the Arrangement view.

5. Lyrics & Vocals
Open Vocal Director → choose theme (“dark chill”, “hopeful”).

AI writes lyrics → maps them to melody → displays timing cues.

6. Mix & Master
Each track has volume, pan, EQ, and plugin slots.

Toggle AI Mastering for automatic tone balancing and loudness.

7. Save / Autosave
Your session auto-saves every 3 minutes.

Manual save: Ctrl+S / ⌘S → saves .lps file.

🎛️ AI Features Quick Reference
Feature	Trigger	Result
Generate Arrangement	AI → Generate	Full structure & instrumentation
Generate Melody	AI → Melody	Melody in selected style
Harmonize	AI → Harmonize MIDI	Adds chords/harmony
Lyrics	Vocal Director → Suggest Lyrics	Creates lyric lines per bar
Mastering	Mixer → AI Master	Auto-EQ, compression, limiter
Style Memory	Automatic	Learns from previous saves
🧩 Plugin Support
Supports VST3 and Audio Unit (AU).

Plugins stored locally; no online authorization required.

Scan on first launch (Preferences → Plugins → Rescan).

🎥 Video Scoring
Drop .mp4 or .mov file into the video pane.

Sync to tempo: right-click video → “Sync to BPM”.

Use markers to align musical hits with video cues.

🧱 Troubleshooting
Issue	Fix
No sound	Check device in Preferences → Audio.
High CPU	Lower buffer size or disable video playback.
Crash detected	LoopMind restores last autosave automatically.
Plugins missing	Re-scan plugins or verify path in Preferences.
🪶 Tip: AI Commands You Can Type
Try these in the AI Console:

make a trap intro at 140 bpm
build a chillhop verse with piano
add jazzy chords under the melody
generate lyrics about city lights
master track for streaming
📦 Updating
Every release ships with a loopmind_build_manifest.json that defines build and version data.
To update:

Replace the manifest in your install directory.

Run build_release.sh to recompile the latest version.

🧠 Feedback & Logs
All logs are stored at:

~/Documents/LoopMind_Logs/
Include these if reporting bugs or crashes.
